# SYNOPSIS
#
#   COFLO_ARG_WITH_DIR([VARIABLE], [with-option-suffix], [description of the directory],
#      [ACTION_IF_FOUND], [ACTION_IF_NOT_FOUND])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Adds options to the generated configure which requre a directory to be specified with either:
#       "configure --with-<with-option-suffix>=/path/to/dir"
#   or:
#       "configure VARIABLE=/path/to/file"
#   Specified file is checked for existence, readability, and that it's a regular directory.  Configuration
#   aborts if the file is not specified or if any of the checks fail.
#   The given path is stored in the precious variable VARIABLE.
